## My process

### Built with

- HTML with Emmet
- CSS (flexbox, custom properties, media queries)
- VSCode

### What I learned

This project wasn't much different from the last one I did, excpet for the use of media queries (although I probably could have done without them). The mobile layout could use some improvement for certain resolutions, but other than that I'm pretty proud of everything.
